# Minesweeper
Console Minesweeper game in Java. 
My first project on Java that I've done by myself. Hopefully, I can improve it soon and make a version with a GUI, but for now, this version fully works in the console. To play you select your difficulty from Easy (9x9 grid 10 bombs), Medium(16x16 grid 40 bombs), Hard (16x30 grid 99 bombs). Then every turn you select an action between Flag, and Reveal, and input the coordinates of the tile you want to perform the action on. The game ends when all tiles without bombs are revealed, or when you reveal a tile with a bomb on it. 

NOTES: 
- I haven't added a timer so there's no way to score it yet, for now you either win or lose
- I haven't implemented first click safe yet either so be weary of that too
